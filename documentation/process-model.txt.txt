This project has stable requirements and a fixed time frame. Because of this, there is little need for flexibility. Instead, stability and consistancy is desired at every step of the process. As such, a prescriptive model would fit the project the best. Out of the prescriptive models, the one that is the best for responding to unforseen programming problems while still retaining the most stability would be the Unified Process. The Unified Process goes through every activity in the generic process model but also alows for more iterations if needed.
We followed this process model fairly closely. The communication stage was provided to us in the form of the requirements page. From there, we went into the planning and modeling stages to create a rough outline of the program and delegated tasks from there. The construction phase consisted of us completing our respective tasks and reconvening to integrate them together. During the integration of each part of the program, some issues arose that required another quick loop around the model. We created a new set of tasks to assist in the integration of each module based on the original models we created plus some tweaks we made to address the problems that arose. From there we went back into construction and fully integrated the modules together for the final release.
